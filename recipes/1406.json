Make and bake cake mix as directed on box, using water, oil and eggs. Cool 10 minutes. Remove from pans to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 1 hour.\nCut 1 cake in half lengthwise, making 2 half-circles. Sculpt 1 half-circle into a head and the other half-circle into a tail (see diagram).

Place body on tray; arrange head and tail pieces next to body.\nSpoon frosting into large bowl. Stir in enough food color until desired green color. To 'crumb-coat' cake, spread thin layer of frosting over cake pieces to seal in crumbs. Freeze cake 30 to 60 minutes.\nFrost cake pieces with remaining frosting. Decorate with yellow candies.
