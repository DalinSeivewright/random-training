  "instructions": "Bring 3 to 4 quarts of salted water to a boil in a large pot. Sprinkle in the rice by the fistful. When the water returns to a boil, stir once, lower the heat, and simmer until the rice is al dente, 15 to 18 minutes.\nWhile the rice cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over a low flame. Stir in the garlic; then sprinkle in the basil. After a couple of minutes (when the garlic is translucent), mix in the salt, pepper, vinegar, and tomatoes. Gently turn the tomatoes once or twice to coat them with the flavored oil, warming them through but not cooking them down into a sauce.\nDrain the rice in a sieve or colander, but don't shake it dry. Turn it into a warmed serving bowl. Immediately sprinkle in the mozzarella cubes, a few at a time, stirring with each addition so they don't clump together. Then gently mix in the contents of the skillet and serve.",
