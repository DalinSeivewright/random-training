  "instructions": "Heat the oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat.\nMix remaining ingredients together in a medium bowl until smooth.\nCheck if the oil is hot enough by sprinkling a bit of flour into it. If the flour sizzles right away, the oil is ready.\nSpoon about 5 or 6 walnut-size balls of the batter, very carefully, into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes.\nRemove fritters and place on a paper-towel-lined baking sheet to drain while frying the remaining fritters.\nServe the fritters hot with butter and marmalade if desired.",
