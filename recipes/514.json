  "instructions": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees.\nPlace the cooked sweet potatoes in a bowl and add the 1/2 cup coconut milk and butter. Beat with a hand mixer until smooth. Add the roasted garlic, thyme, salt and pepper and beat to incorporate.\nIn a small bowl whisk together the other 2 tablespoons of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon maple syrup, and the olive oil. Place one sheet of puff pastry on a cutting board and cut into 9 equal size squares. Add about a teaspoon of the potato mixture in the center of each square. Brush the perimeter of each square with the coconut milk and olive oil mixture. Fold the puff pastry over the mixture forming a triangle shape. With a fork crimp the edges in order to ensure no filling escapes during baking.\nBrush the tops of each of the turnovers with some more coconut milk and olive oil mixture. Place on a lightly greased baking sheet and bake for about 15 minutes at 400 degrees F or until golden brown.",
