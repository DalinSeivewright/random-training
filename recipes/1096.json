  "instructions": "In a large heavy saucepan, combine sugar, corn syrup and water. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Cover and cook for 3 minutes or until sugar is dissolved. Uncover; cook on medium-high heat, without stirring, until a candy thermometer reads 300 degrees F(hard-crack stage). Remove from the heat; stir in extract and food coloring (keep face away from mixture as the aroma will be very strong). Pour into a buttered 13-in. x 9-in. x 2-in. pan. When cooled slightly but not hardened, cut into 1-in. squares. Cool completely. Store in an airtight container.",
