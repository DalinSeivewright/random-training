  "instructions": "Line a colander with moistened cheesecloth and set it over a large bowl. In a large saucepan, bring the milk to a gentle boil. Add 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice and cook over low heat, stirring gently, until curds form and rise to the surface, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, cover and let stand for 5 minutes; the curds will firm up slightly.\nUsing a slotted spoon with small holes, gently scoop the curds into the colander; discard the liquid. Let the ricotta drain for 15 minutes, then gently lift the cheesecloth to flip the curd and let drain for 15 minutes longer. Transfer the ricotta to a bowl and season with salt.\nPreheat the broiler. Arrange the bread slices on a baking sheet and brush with olive oil. Broil the bread 8 inches from the heat for about 4 minutes, turning once, until golden and crisp.\nIn a bowl, whisk the remaining 1 tablespoon of lemon juice with the 2 tablespoons of oil; season with salt and pepper. Add the radishes and arugula and toss.\nSpread the ricotta generously on the toasts and top with the radishes and arugula. Garnish with pepper and serve.",
