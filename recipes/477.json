Transfer to a plate. Add onion, bell pepper, garlic, and remaining oil to wok; stir-fry until onions are soft, about 3 minutes. Add paprika and stir-fry 1 minute.\nReturn sausage to skillet along with tomatoes and shrimp. Stir-fry until shrimp are just cooked through and pink, about 2 minutes. Add rice and peas to wok and cook, stirring, until ingredients are combined. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Top with parsley and serve.",
