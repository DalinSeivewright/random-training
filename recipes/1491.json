Cover, and refrigerate.\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Coat a 9x13 inch baking pan with cooking spray. In a food processor, process bread to create small crumbs.\nUsing a small sharp knife, cut in half horizontally through the center of each chicken breast half, creating a pocket. Fill each pocket with 1/4 of the crab mixture. Then dip each chicken piece into flour, eggs, and finally bread crumbs to coat. Cover completely. Arrange in prepared baking pan.\nBake in preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and breading is golden brown.",
