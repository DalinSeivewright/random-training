  "instructions": "In a 7- to 8-inch frying pan over medium-high heat, combine garlic with 1/2 tablespoon of the oil. Stir often until limp but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add wine, lemon juice, and capers. Boil, uncovered, until reduced to 1/2 cup, 3 to 4 minutes; keep sauce warm.\nPreheat oven broiler. Rinse halibut, pat dry, and cut into 4 to 6 equal portions. Rub fish with remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste, and arrange in a single layer in a 12- by 17-inch broiler pan (without rack).\nBroil halibut 3 to 4 inches from heat for 3 minutes. Using a spatula, gently turn fish over, sprinkle with cheese, and broil until opaque but still moist-looking in center of thickest part (cut to test), about 3 more minutes.\nTransfer fish to a platter or individual plates and top with sauce.",
