  "instructions": "Heat the oven to 450 degrees F. Put the oil in a small stainless-steel, enameled, or nonstick roasting pan and heat in the oven for 5 minutes. Season the fish with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Put the fish in the hot pan; cook in the oven until just done, about 8 minutes.\nRemove the fish from the pan and transfer to paper towels to drain. Pour off any oil remaining in the pan. Put the pan over moderate heat and add the wine and the chopped scallion bulbs. Bring to a boil, scraping the bottom of the pan to dislodge any brown bits. Cook until the wine is reduced to approximately 3 tablespoons, 1 to 2 minutes.\nReduce the heat to low and whisk in the butter. Season the sauce with a pinch each of salt and pepper. Put the fish on plates, browned-side up. Sprinkle the scallion greens over the top. Spoon the sauce around the fish.",
