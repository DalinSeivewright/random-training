Chop giblets and cut neck into 3 or 4 pieces.\nCombine giblets, neck, onion, carrots, and 1/2 cup broth in a 5- to 6-quart pan over high heat. Boil and stir often until meat and vegetables are very well browned, 15 to 20 minutes. Add another 1/2 cup broth, scrape browned bits free, and repeat.\nAdd remaining 9 cups broth, bay leaf, sage, wine, and pepper and stir to scrape browned bits free. Cover and simmer until giblets are very tender when pierced, about 1 1/2 hours. If desired, add liver and simmer for 10 more minutes.\nPour broth through a fine strainer into a bowl; measure. If you have more than 8 cups, boil to reduce; if you have less, add more broth.\nDiscard vegetables. Pull neck meat from bones; discard bones. Finely chop meat and giblets.\nIn a small bowl, smoothly blend cornstarch with 2/3 cup water; stir into broth. To roasting pan with drippings, add 1/2 cup water; stir on high heat, scraping browned bits free; add to broth in 5- to 6-quart pan. Stir broth over high heat until boiling, about 5 minutes.
