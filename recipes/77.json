  "instructions": "In a 6- to 8-quart pan over high heat, bring about 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook just until tender to bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.\nMeanwhile, in a large, shallow dish, combine olives, tomatoes, basil, and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese. Gently fold cooked pasta with olive and cheese mixture and 1 tablespoon lemon olive oil; set aside.\nTo a 10- to 12-inch nonstick frying pan over medium-high heat, add 2 tablespoons lemon olive oil. Cut each tuna steak into 2 equal pieces (about 3 ounces each). When oil is hot, add steaks, cover, and cook just until opaque in center (cut to test), 4 to 6 minutes total; turn steaks to brown both sides. Lay tuna on top of pasta and drizzle pan juices over all.\nServe dish with extra parmesan cheese and salt and pepper to add as desired.",
