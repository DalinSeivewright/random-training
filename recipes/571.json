  "instructions": "In a shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs, Parmesan, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper.\nIn a large saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over moderately low heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and stir for 30 seconds. Stir in the tomatoes, red-pepper flakes, and the remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce the heat, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until thickened, about 20 minutes. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.\nMeanwhile, in a large frying pan, heat 1/4 to 1/2 inch of cooking oil over moderate heat until very hot. Dip each chicken breast into the eggs and then into the bread crumbs, coating well. Fry in the hot oil, turning once, until golden brown and just cooked through, about 15 minutes in all. Drain on paper towels.\nWhile the chicken is cooking, heat the broiler. Brush the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over the cut-side of the rolls and toast under the broiler until golden, about 2 minutes. Spoon half the tomato sauce onto the bottom half of the rolls. Top with the chicken, the remaining sauce, and the other half of the rolls.",
